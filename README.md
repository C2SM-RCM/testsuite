# Introduction

The testsuite is an open-source framework for regression testing of atmospheric models written in Python. It has originally been written for the COSMO model (http://www.cosmo-model.org/) 
but has subsequently been generalized to work with other atmospheric models as well. Some adaptions to the models typically have to be done in order for the testsuite to work.
